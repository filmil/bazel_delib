# Bazel Delib: compile your favorite libraries [![Test status](https://github.com/filmil/bazel_delib/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/filmil/bazel_delib/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

sometimes a frustrating experience.  Bzlmod is here, but not nearly popular
enough to guarantee that a library I need will be available for me to use.
So, here we are.
